      <description>In the late 1990s when internet consumption was booming and microprocessors were growing by Moore&amp;rsquo;s law, A need to build large scale systems was arising.

      <description>Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx. I use Arch btw But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.
Some Points  Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567). I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).</description>
