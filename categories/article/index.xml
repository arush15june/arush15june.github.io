Clocks and Timers A system might have two kinds of clocks available to use in the system, a Wall-Clock Timer and a Monotonic Clock.</description></item><item><title>Understanding x86 Virtualization</title><link>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</guid><description>Virtualization enables a computer system to run multiple operating systems simultaneously and isolated from each other. x86 is the Instruction Set Architecture found in most PCs and Servers today, we will take a look at how x86 hardware is virtualized by applications like VMWare Workstation and QEMU.

Advantages of Virtualization Developers can have multiple virtual machines running various environments required for development and testing.</description></item><item><title>Windows Productivity Max</title><link>/posts/2018-11-26-windows-productivity-max/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018-11-26-windows-productivity-max/</guid><description>Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx. I use Arch btw But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.
Some Points Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567). I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).</description></item></channel></rss>
