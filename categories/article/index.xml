Clocks and Timers A system might have two kinds of clocks available to use in the system, a Wall-Clock Timer and a Monotonic Clock.</description></item><item><title>Understanding x86 Virtualization</title><link>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</guid><description>Virtualization enables a computer system to run multiple operating systems simultaneously and isolated from each other. x86 is the Instruction Set Architecture found in most PCs and Servers today, we will take a look at how x86 hardware is virtualized by applications like VMWare Workstation and QEMU.

I use Arch btw But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.
Some Points Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567). I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).</description></item></channel></rss>
