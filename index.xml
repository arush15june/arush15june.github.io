BinRec is novel tool for binary lifting and recompilation which uses dynamic techniques to generate new binaries, in contrast to existing biniary recompilers like McSema and Rev.Ng which use static analysis and heuristic techniques to facilitate recompilation. BinRec employs dynamic analysis to lift binary code to LLVM IR and subsequently lowers it back to machine code, producing a &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; binary.</description></item><item><title>Practical Papers: Chord, A Scalable Peer-To-Peer Lookup Protocol</title><link>/posts/2020-28-01-chord/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-28-01-chord/</guid><description>The post is an explanation of the Chord protocol and discussion of my implementation of the same in Golang.

Traditionally, a single computer system runs a single operating system. Instead of adding more power to a single machine running applications, businesses like IBM and Microsoft started building reliable and performant distributed systems using unreliable commodity hardware. Datacenters expanded in capacity comprising thousands of physical machines serving applications on the internet.</description></item><item><title>Windows Productivity Max</title><link>/posts/2018-11-26-windows-productivity-max/</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018-11-26-windows-productivity-max/</guid><description>Setup Windows 10 for Productivity Maxx.
