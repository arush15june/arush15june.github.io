Wall-Clock Timer
This represents the time as it will be on a wall-clock. Usually, wall-clock time is counted as the number of time units since January 1, 1970 00:00:00 UTC or EPOCH. This clock can go forward or backwards in time as desired by synchronization algorithms (NTP) or the user to represent the current time, due to this reason they are not recommended for measuring durations.</description></item></channel></rss>
