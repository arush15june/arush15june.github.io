Clocks and Timers A system might have two kinds of clocks available to use in the system, a Wall-Clock Timer and a Monotonic Clock.</description></item><item><title>Papers: BinRec: Dynamic Binary Lifting and Recompilation</title><link>/posts/2020-04-30-binrec/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-04-30-binrec/</guid><description>A summary of the paper BinRec: Dynamic Binary Lifting and Recompilation presented at EuroSys'20. BinRec is novel tool for binary lifting and recompilation which uses dynamic techniques to generate new binaries, in contrast to existing biniary recompilers like McSema and Rev.Ng which use static analysis and heuristic techniques to facilitate recompilation. BinRec employs dynamic analysis to lift binary code to LLVM IR and subsequently lowers it back to machine code, producing a &amp;ldquo;recovered&amp;rdquo; binary.</description></item><item><title>Practical Papers: Chord, A Scalable Peer-To-Peer Lookup Protocol</title><link>/posts/2020-28-01-chord/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2020-28-01-chord/</guid><description>The post is an explanation of the Chord protocol and discussion of my implementation of the same in Golang. Chord is one of the original Distributed Hash Table projects from the MIT PDOS group at Computer Science and AI Laboratory, MIT. Here is a link to the original research for your reading pleasure.

We won the second prize hacking hardware with our 15$ (1000 INR) SDR and Logic Analyzer in Doha, Qatar! In October 2019, Members of Al Capwn flew from New Delhi, India to Doha, Qatar to attend Qatar International Cybersecurity Contest at Hamad Bin Khalifa University. We are thankful of HBKU for sponsoring the complete trip. Specfically, We participated in the Qatar International Hacking Contest, a hardware hacking competition.</description></item><item><title>Understanding x86 Virtualization</title><link>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2019-11-11-understanding-x86-virtualization/</guid><description>Virtualization enables a computer system to run multiple operating systems simultaneously and isolated from each other. x86 is the Instruction Set Architecture found in most PCs and Servers today, we will take a look at how x86 hardware is virtualized by applications like VMWare Workstation and QEMU.

I use Arch btw But, When I am not doing shenanigans on my Arch (AntergOS) with KDE setup (which i absolutely love), I use Windows 10. Which is very useable (atleast, for me) contrary to popular linux chad opinion.
Some Points Windows 10 Home came preinstalled on my laptop (Dell 7567). I like using Windows 10 (not as much as the KDE setup, though).</description></item><item><title>SKYHack 2018 Building for Disaster Relief</title><link>/posts/2018-10-22-skyhack-2018-building-for-disaster-relief/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/posts/2018-10-22-skyhack-2018-building-for-disaster-relief/</guid><description>SKYHack 2018: Building for Disaster Relief This blog post details my experience in participating in SkyHack 2018, a hackathon by the Chhattisgarh Government to build applications for Android Phones going to be distributed as part of the Sanchar Kranti Yojana.

a silly idea popular indian fashion website allows you to throw a picture of a random tshirt in their search bar and they&amp;rsquo;ll find you how a similar tshirt available in the store.
Idea: How could i go about building something similar of my own? A Mini Reverse Image Search!</description></item></channel></rss>
